## 1 Summary

Paragraph with a quick explanation of the proposal.

## 2 Motivation

Try to answer the following questions in a short paragraph:

- Why are we doing this?
- What use cases does it support?
- What is the expected outcome?
- How is the company as a whole delivering more value after this?

## 3 Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the business rules to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to execute.

This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the problem is solved.

Any new terminology should be defined here.
